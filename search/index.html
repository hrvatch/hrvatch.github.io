        "content": "Ultimately, I decided I want to manage my hobby projects in a Scrum style.I can see people screaming: “Are you insane? What drugs are you on? Why do you want to turn your fun activity into something that feels like some annoying and life-draining corporate project?” First of all, I don’t think the Scrum itself is stupid and life draining, it’s the 1000 other things like managers emphasizing and prioritizing writing Jira tickets and doing time estimates while you’re trying to deliver that bug fix on the Friday afternoon. This is not it. Here, you’re your own manager, and Scrum is just a way of keeping track of things. Besides there are numerous benefits, but the most important ones to me:  I want to keep track of my projects,  I want to keep myself accountable, and actually finish my projects.There are some additional benefits that are not obvious at first. Thinking about how to decompose your project into achievable tasks forces you to ACTUALLY think hard about what you’re trying to do, it forces you to do a deep analysis. Once you break it down, you’ll have clear steps on how you’re going to achieve something, and you’ll also have some insight when and how you’re going to complete your project.Of course, I don’t think this is feasible for every little thing I do. I quickly found out it’s better to start immediately working on my idea, create something concrete, gather more information and to get a feeling is this something I’d really like to do or this was some passing whim. After I’m sure I find it fun (or useful), I’ll do some “project planning”.        Setting SMART goalsCouple of months ago my girlfriend (who is very smart) taught me about setting SMART goals. I keep forgetting what the acronym stands for, but I vividly remember when she first told me about it, it resonated with me. Well, instead of asking her for the 100th time what each letter means, I’ll now write it down:  S - Specific: Clearly define what you want to achieve, including details like who, what, where and why. (e.g., “I’ll build a RISC-V core”, becomes “I’ll build a basic, single cycle, 32-bit RISC-V core supporting IMAC instruction set to improve my digital design skills, and to become familiar with the RISC-V ecosystem”.  M - Measurable: Include criteria to track progress and know when you’ve succeeded, using numbers, percentages, or other data points.  A - Achievable: Ensure the goal is challenging but realistic, with resources and capabilities to reach it.  R - Relevant: Confirm the goal matters to your broader objectives and is worthwhile.  T - Time-bound: Set a specific deadline or time frame for completion, creating urgency and focus.  Task breakdownThe next thing I decided on is the Project and Task breakdown. I decided on the following:  I want to have the following hierarchy: Projects-&gt;Epics-&gt;Stories-&gt;Tasks.  Each project can have multiple Epics. Each Epic describes a significant feature that I need to develop or some area that I need to study that would take multiple months.  Epics are further decomposed into Stories. Each Story contains a meaningful unit of work that can be done in a month or so.  Stories are decomposed into tasks. Each task would represent a concrete action needed to complete a Story.Here is one hypothetical project example that for the hierarchy I’ve described above. Let’s say I want to design a floating-point unit. This would be my Project. Now, there are multiple ways how I would decompose this Project into Epics, but let’s say my approach is the following:  Floating point unit documentation,  Floating point unit design,  Floating point unit validation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).  etc.The 2nd Epic - Floating point unit design - I would further decompose into the following Stories:  Multiplication (F.MUL),  Leading Zero Counter (LZC),  Division (F.DIV),  Square root (F.SQRT),  etc.The F.MUL story can be decomposed into the following tasks:  Implement mantissa multiplication,  Implement normalization,  Implement exponent calculation,  Implement rounding,  Create a Formal verification environment,  Get a Formal proof of the F.MUL datapath,  etc.And here is a visualization of the above:flowchart LRA(Floating point unit)A --&gt; E1(Epic: FPU documentation)A --&gt; E2(Epic: FPU design)A --&gt; E3(Epic: FPU implementation on an FPGA)subgraph FPU documentationE1 --&gt; E1S1(...)endsubgraph FPU implementation on an FPGAE3 --&gt; E3S1(...)endsubgraph \"FPU Design\"E2 --&gt; E2S1(Story: Multiplication F.MUL)E2 --&gt; E2S2(Story: Leading Zero Counter LZC)E2 --&gt; E2S3(Story: Division F.DIV)E2 --&gt; E2S4(Story: Square root F.SQRT)E2S2 --&gt; E2S2T1(...)E2S3 --&gt; E2S3T1(...)E2S4 --&gt; E2S4T1(...)subgraph F.MULE2S1 --&gt; E2S1T1(Task: Implement mantissa multiplication)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T2(Task: Implement normalization)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T3(Task: Implement exponent calculation)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T4(Task: Implement rounding)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T5(Task: Create Formal verification environment)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T6(Task: Get a Formal proof of the F.MUL datapath)endendChoosing tool for project and task planningWhen it came time to pick tool for project management I wanted a tool that supported the followingcriteria:  It must be free to use,  It must be a web based tool because I’m working on multiple machines and multiple operating systems,  It should have an establishaed reputation, i.e., there should be an existing user base, I don’twant the tool to be cancelled or disappear overnight,  It should support building a hierarchy of Projects-&gt;Epics-&gt;Stories-&gt;Tasks as I’ve outlined previously,  It should allow me to keep track of time for each Task,  It should be possible to have a board (Kanban style) where I could see the task breakdown for the current month (Sprint),  Once I set it it up, it should be easy to use - I should be able to plan tasks for the current month witha couple of clicks, adding Tasks, Stories, Epics and Projects should be simple.There are bajilion tools that fit this criteria; I’ve spend couple of days trying some of those. Thereare two tools that I really liked: JetBrains YouTrackand Notion. In the end I chose Notion, not because one tool is betterthan the other, it was simply a coin toss choice, and Notion won.        Retrospective: Using NotionIn retrospective, Notion was actually not that easy to set-up. It took me roughly 3 days to set up everything. In these 3 days I’ve included research, watching tutorials and all the trial and error before I got what I actually wanted. It might be a  skill issue, but I think the main reason for the non-ease-of-use is it has a very rich featurset. It takes some time to get familiar with the required features, tool flow and the intended way or work.I’ll mention two resources that actually got me started:  Anthropic’s Claude AI - It helped alot when I started using Notion. Btw I’m notendorsing Claude above any other currently available LLMs, I used it because I had the fullsubscription at the time.  The Notion Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners on YouTube.This video helped ALOT. It’s long (roughly 2 hours) but it’s worth watching if you’re seriousabout using Notion. The video author also has lots of other videos on topics surrounding Notionand productivity in general. Fully recommend.  Using Notion to set things in motionFirst I’ll start with the results, and then I’ll provide a step-by-step solution on how to implementthis yourself in Notion.The solution I’ve built focuses around four main databases: one database containing Projects,one database containing Epics, one database containing all Stories and one database containing all Tasks. Each project gets its own separate page.The Projects database lists all the projects with their status, description, start and end date.                Notion database containing a list of Projects with the accompanying propertiesThe Epics database contains all Epics for all Projects. Each Epic is assigned to on or more Projects. Each Epic contains a list of Stories required to finish that particular Epic. The Estimated Hours, Actual Hours, Reamining Hours, and Progress are automatically calculated. Estimated and Actual Hours are sum of the same-named properties of all Stories contained inside an Epic.                Database containing list of all Epics. Estimated hours and Actual hours are automatically calculated by summing those properties for all the Stories contained in an EpicThe Stories database contains all Stories for all Projects. Each Story is assigned to one (or more)Epics. Estimated Hours, Actual Hours, Reamining Hours and Progress are automatically calculated.Like in the Epics database, the Estimated Hours and the Actual Hours are are calculated by summingthe values of the same-names properties for all Tasks contained within a Story.                Database containing list of all Stories. Estimated hours and Actual hours are automatically calculated by summing the same-named properties for all the Tasks contained inside a StoryThe Tasks database contains as list of Tasks for all Projects. Each Tasks is described with thefollowing properties:  Name of the task,  Task description,  Status (In progress, Ongoing, Done),  Estimated hours - time it takes to finish a task,  Actual Hours - time it took to finish a task,  Over-Under - automatically calculated property, describing if the task was over or under estimated,  Variance - time difference between the Estimated and Actual Hours. Also auto calculated.                Tasks database on the Backlog view. The Backlog view is used to see all the tasks that are not being worked on this month.Tasks that are going to be workd on in the current month are displayed on a board. The Kanban boardstyle is, in my opinion, a great tool to visually depict work at various stages of a process.                The Kanban board show which tasks are planned to be worked on this month, but are still not in progress, tasks I'm currently working on, and tasks I've finished this month.As I’ve mentioned before, each project gets a dedicated Project dashboard page. This page essentiallycontains a link to the Epics, Stories and Tasks databases, but it’s set up in a such a way to providea clear overview of the Project.                Tasks in the Project dashboard are displayed in two different views: Kanban style, and as a list of Project relatedtasks currently in the backlog.                Steps to set up a Scrum-based project management system in NotionI’ve split the setup into the following steps:  Core database setup,  Create essential views,  Create project dashboard template,  Creating a project,  Sprint (month) planning and execution",

        "content": "Before starting with any kind of development on Raspberry Pi Pico2W I first need to setup the toolchain: SDK, compiler, linker and debugger. In this post I describe the following steps:  Downloading and setting up Raspberry Pi Pico2W SDK,  preparing and compiliing the GNU cross-compiler to compile RISC-V binaries,  Setting up OpenOCDIt’s important to note, these steps work well on my machine (x86-64, Arch Linux, btw), some slightchanges are probably required if there is a need to build on other machine and/or different Linux distro.To verify I have everything I need, and everything is setup properly, I’ll develop a simple LED blinky program, and enable UART.Build environmentTo set-up my build environment for Raspberry Pi Pico2_W, i’ll combine instructions from Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK document and instructions from riscv-gnu-toolchain Github page.First I’ll install all dependencies:$ sudo pacman -Syu curl python3 libmpc mpfr gmp base-devel texinfo gperf patchutils bc zlib expat libslirpThen I want to build a cross compiler that runs on my host machine (e.g. x86-64 Linux PC) but produces executables for a different target architecture (e.g. RISC-V).Host = where the compiler runs.Target = where the generated program runs.There are two flavors of a cross compiler for x86-64 Linux host:      Newlib cross compiler (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc)Target: bare-metal systems (no OS, or minimal runtime).Uses Newlib as the C standard library.Good for firmware, bootloaders, small MCUs.        Linux cross compiler (riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc)Target: RISC-V systems running Linux.Uses glibc (GNU C library), same as native Linux distros.Produces programs you can run under a Linux kernel on RISC-V hardware (or emulators like QEMU).  I’ll now proceed with building Newlib cross compiler and the acompanying binuitls. First I’ll create a directory where the sources and the built binaries will be stored. This directory (install path) needs to be writeable.$ mkdir -p ~/rp2350/gcc-rp2350-no-zcmpChange into ~/rp2350 directory, clone the riscv-gnu-toolchain repository and change into the riscv-gnu-toolchain directory:$ cd ~/rp2350$ git clone https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git $ cd risc-vgnu-toolchain.gitConfigure the build process to target the RISC-V ISA extensions supported by the RP2350, and to place the built binaries into the ~/rp2350/gcc-rp2350-no-zcmp directory:$ ./configure –prefix=~/rp2350/gcc-rp2350-no-zcmp –with-arch=rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb –with-abi=ilp32 –with-multilib-generator=”rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb-ilp32–;rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb-ilp32–”Build the binaries:make -j”$(nproc)”Optional reading:When I first built the RISC-V bare-metal toolchain, I’ve blindly copy-pasted ./configure arguments, but I wandered what do they mean? We’ll here is the explanation:RISC-V --with-arch breakdown--with-arch=rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcbComponents  rv32ima — 32-bit base ISA (I) plus M (mul/div) and A (atomics).  zicsr — Control/status register access (csrr*, csrw*, etc.).  zifencei — Instruction-fetch fence (FENCE.I) to sync I-cache after code/data writes.  zba — Bit-manip “address generation” subset (add/shift patterns that speed indexing).  zbb — Bit-manip “basic” subset (clz/ctz/popcount/min/max/extends/rotates, etc.).  zbs — Bit-manip “single-bit” subset (set/clear/invert/extract by bit index).  zbkb — Bit-manip helpers oriented toward crypto (pack/permute/byte ops); part of scalar-crypto-friendly sets.  zca — Core compressed integer subset (16-bit encodings for common integer ops).  zcb — Extra compressed encodings (requires zca) for further code-size reduction.RISC-V --with-abi=ilp32 breakdown--with-abi=ilp32What it sets  Chooses the default ABI for the toolchain (override per compile with -mabi=...).  ilp32 = int, long, and pointers are 32-bit.  Soft-float ABI: no FP registers used for args/returns; FP math is done in software.When to use  RV32 targets without an FPU (no F/D extensions), or when you explicitly want a soft-float calling convention. This is our case, since RP2350 doesn’t have any hard floating-point unit.  If the RP2350 had single-precision FPU, I’d use ilp32f; if it had double-precision FPU, I’d use ilp32d.Practical effects  Defines the calling convention and type sizes (sizeof(long)==4, sizeof(void*)==4).  Determines which multilib variant is selected/built.  All linked libraries must match the ABI (mixing ilp32 with ilp32f/d will cause link/ABI errors).What --with-multilib-generator=\"…\" does (RISC-V)--with-multilib-generator=\"rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb-ilp32--;rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb-ilp32--\"Purpose--with-multilib-generator= tells the bare-metal RISC-V toolchain build exactly which multilib variants (prebuilt libgcc, newlib, etc.) to produce.The value is a semicolon-separated list of multilib configs.Each config has four parts:&lt;arch string&gt;-&lt;ABI&gt;-&lt;reuse rule with arch&gt;-&lt;reuse rule with sub-extension&gt;(Empty fields mean “no reuse rule here”. This option is supported for riscv*--elf builds.)What your string buildsYou’re asking the build to create two multilib variants:1) rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb + ilp32  32-bit I/M/A base with CSR + fence.i, bit-manip subsets (Zba/Zbb/Zbs), crypto-oriented bit-manip (Zbkb), and compressed subsets (Zca + Zcb).  ABI: ilp32 (32-bit int/long/pointers; soft-float).  Reuse rules: none (the trailing --).2) rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb + ilp32  32-bit I/M/A/C base (so compressed via C), plus the same Z* subsets except Zca/Zcb.  ABI: ilp32.  Reuse rules: none.In short: build two library sets—one for an RV32 IMA core with Z* + Zc* compressed subsets, and one for an RV32 IMAC core with Z* (and C)—both using the ilp32 ABI.Why/when to do this  Smaller, faster build than the default multilib set—only the libraries you actually need are built.  Lets GCC auto-select the “best-fit” multilib at compile/link time among the ones you built.How to use &amp; verifyConfigure (example):./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv \\  --with-multilib-generator=\"rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb-ilp32--;rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb-ilp32--\"make -j\"$(nproc)\"See what was built:riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --print-multi-lib(Shows the two multilibs you requested.)Pick one at compile time (GCC will choose automatically if compatible, but you can be explicit):# Matches variant (1)-march=rv32ima_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb_zca_zcb -mabi=ilp32# Matches variant (2)-march=rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei_zba_zbb_zbs_zbkb -mabi=ilp32  If you request an -march/-mabi combo with no compatible multilib, you can hit link/ABI errors—add another entry to the generator string or adjust your compile flags.Reference: See the toolchain README section “Build with customized multi-lib configure” for the full format, examples, and notes on reuse rules.export PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/ssd1/workspace/pico2w/build-tools/gcc15-rp2350-no-zcmpexport PICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-riscvexport PICO_SDK_PATH=/ssd1/workspace/pico2w/pico-sdkexport PICO_BOARD=pico2_wThe next thing we want to do is we want to test if the board is working correctly.

The boot outcome depends on multiple variables, all described in Chapter 5.2.1 Boot outcomes in [1].  In our case, we want to run our application from the USB bootloader. The USB bootloader will load the application stored in the UF2 [reference] format, and it will write this application to flash. But how does the bootrom know on which core do we want to run this application, RISC-V or ARM? Bootrom needs to locate and viable metadata. This metadata is defined in the Chapter 5.9 Metadata block details in [1]. The Chapter 5.9.5.2 describes Minimum RISC-V IMAGE_DEF. We will use this information",

Nothing gets checked until we have given a verification directive to the tool which states what should be done with that behavior. All properties must have a clock defined explicitly or via a default clock declaration.Assert directiveDirective to the tool to ensure that the property holds, is true, under all circumstances (safety check).Syntax:label : assert property (prop_expr)Examples:P1_INST : assert property (P1(SIG1, SIG2, S3));P2 : assert property ( @(posedge clk) A |-&gt; B );P3 : assert property ( ERROR_CNT != 10 );P1A_INS : assert property (@(posedge clka) (P1A) );// TODO: Add example where there is a property declaration, and then this property is used in an assertionAssume directiveDirective to the tool to limit the behavior of the design under test (DUT) inputs to the behavior specified. Also known as constraints. Assume directives in the simulation are treated as assert directives.Syntax:label : assume property (prop_expr)Examples:P4 : assume property (req &amp;&amp; !gnt |=&gt; req)P5 : assume property ( @(posedge clk3) not(full &amp;&amp; empty) );// TODO: Add an example where there is a property declaration, and then this property is used in an assumptionCover directiveIn the formal verification, a cover directive instructs the formal tool to find at least one valid execution trace in which a specified sequence of events or conditions can occur, given the design logic and any active assumptions  (constraints).Syntax:label : cover property (prop_expr)Examples:C1 : cover sequence (full ##[+] empty );C2 : cover property ( @(posedge clk) (SEQ1) );// TODO: Add an example where there is a sequence declaration and then this sequence is used in a coverFor cover property it is recommended for prop_expr to only be a sequence, i.e. not contain implication operators |-&gt; or |=&gt; and the cover directive states cover sequence instead of cover propertyCycle delaysSpecifies the number of clock ticks from the current clock tick until the next specified behavior occurs.Syntax:##[N:M]##NN and M are constants know at elaboration. M can be the symbol $ meaning “infinity”. M &gt;= N. M and N can be 0.Example:P6: assert property( A |=&gt; B ##[0:$] C );P7: assert property( A |=&gt; ##3 C );Implication operators (|-&gt;, |=&gt;)Implication operators define a relationship between an enabling condition and a fulfilling condition.A property using an implication operator holds true if either:  The fulfilling condition occurs as a consequence of the enabling condition, or  The enabling condition never occurs.Overlapping Implication (|-&gt;)Syntax:sequence_expr |-&gt; property_exprThis property holds true under the following conditions:  If sequence_expr completes then property_expr starts in the same cycle and eventually completes.  seqeunce_expr never completes.Example:    P8: assert property (A ##1 B |-&gt; C ##1 D );        P8 passes if the following sequence is observed:    (A ##1 (B &amp;&amp; C) ##1 D);      Non-Overlapping Implication (|=&gt;)Syntax:sequence_expr |=&gt; property_expr This property holds true under the following conditions:  If sequence_expr completes then property_expr starts in the next cycle and eventually completes.  sequence_expr never completes.Example:    P9: assert property ( A ##1 B |=&gt; C ##1 D );        P9 passes if the following sequence is observed:    (A ##1 B ##1 C ##1 D);      Nesting implication operatorsIt is not recommended to nest implication operators, as it can easily become confusing: For example:P10: assert property (A |=&gt; B |=&gt; C );This is exactly equivalent to:P10_EQUIVALENT : assert property (A ##1 B |=&gt; C);P10 or P10_EQUIVALENT would not fail if the sequence (A ##1 !B) is observed.Disabling propertiesSyntax:disable iff (boolean_expr)When boolean_expr is true, the property is temporarily disabled, and all active checks or pending evaluations for that property (including overlapping ones) are canceled.For example, if a property checks that a request must eventually be followed by a grant, we’d usually want a reset to clear any pending request-to-grant expectations.After reset, new requests start fresh obligations.Example:P11: assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) req |=&gt; ##[*] gnt);Default DisableIf the same disable condition applies to many properties, it can be defined once as a default disable instead of repeating it for each property.default disable iff (boolean_expr);This default disable applies to all properties, in the current scope only, which do not have an explicit disable iff defined:default disable iff (CANCEL)P12: assert property(@(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n) A |=&gt; B);P13: assert property(@(posedge clk) C |=&gt; D);In this example:  P12 uses its own disable condition (!rst_n)  P13 uses the default disable condition (CANCEL)Both default disable iff and explicit disable iff are asynchronous — they take effect immediately, regardless of the property’s clocking event.Clocking Properties  Every SVA property must be clocked — unlocked properties are not allowed.  The clock can come from one of the following:          An explicit clocking event when the property is declared      An explicit clocking event when the property is instantiated      A default clocking declaration        An explicit clock declaration always overrides the default clocking.  Sequences without an explicit clock inherit the clock from their parent property.  default clocking applies only within its current scope.  Only one default clocking declaration is allowed per scope.Example:default clocking MYCLK @(posedge clk);endclockingproperty P14;  A |=&gt; B;endpropertyproperty P15;  @(posedge clk1) A |=&gt; B;endpropertyP14_A: assert property (@(posedge clk2) P14);P14_B: assert property (P14);P15_A: assert property (P15);P16: assert property (@(posedge clk3) A |-&gt; B);P17: assert property (C |-&gt; D);  P14_A uses clk2, overriding all others.  P14_B uses the default clock (posedge clk).  P15_A uses the explicit clock defined in P15 (clk1).  P16 uses clk3 (explicit).  P17 inherits the default clock.Builtin Functions            Function      Description                  $past(expr, N)      Value of expr N cycles ago (defaults to 1 if N is omitted).              $rose(expr)      TRUE when expr transitions from 0 → 1.              $fell(expr)      TRUE when expr transitions from 1 → 0.              $stable(expr)      TRUE if expr has not changed since the previous cycle.              $onehot(expr)      TRUE if exactly one bit of expr is 1.              $onehot0(expr)      TRUE if zero or one bit of expr is 1.              $isunknown(expr)      TRUE if any bit of expr is X or Z.              $countones(expr)      Returns the number of bits in expr that are 1.      RepetitionRepetition operators specify how many times a sequence element must occur and whether occurrences must be consecutive or can be spread apart.[* const_or_range_expression]Consecutive repetition — the expression must be TRUE for a specified number of consecutive cycles.Example:(a[*2] ##2 b[*2]) |=&gt; da must hold for 2 cycles in a row, then after 2 cycles, b must hold for 2 cycles in a row.[-&gt; const_or_range_expression]Goto repetition — looks for the Nth occurrence of a sequence element and then continues from there.This operator skips ahead until the given count of matches has been reached.Example:a ##1 b[-&gt;5] ##1 cMatches when:  a occurs  then the 5th occurrence of b (not necessarily consecutive)  then c occurs one cycle laterSo b may appear several times, but the property only matches when the 5th b is seen.[= const_or_range_expression]Non-consecutive repetition — the expression must be TRUE a given number of times, but not necessarily on consecutive cycles. Other conditions may appear between repetitions.Example:s1 |=&gt; (b [=5] ##1 c)After s1 completes:  b must be TRUE five times in total,  these occurrences can be spread out in time,  and after that, c must occur one cycle later.Shortcuts            Notation      Equivalent Form      Meaning                  R[*]      R[*0:$]      Repeat zero or more times              ##[*]      ##[0:$]      Delay zero or more cycles              R[+]      R[*1:$]      Repeat one or more times              ##[+]      ##[1:$]      Delay one or more cycles      Constructs not recommended for formalThe following properties will cause formal tools to either run slower or not converge at all.
