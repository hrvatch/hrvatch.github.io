        "content": "Ultimately, I decided I want to manage my hobby projects in a Scrum style.I can see people screaming: “Are you insane? What drugs are you on? Why do you want to turn your fun activity into something that feels like some annoying and life-draining corporate project?” First of all, I don’t think the Scrum itself is stupid and life draining, it’s the 1000 other things like managers emphasizing and prioritizing writing Jira tickets and doing time estimates while you’re trying to deliver that bug fix on the Friday afternoon. This is not it. Here, you’re your own manager, and Scrum is just a way of keeping track of things. Besides there are numerous benefits, but the most important ones to me:  I want to keep track of my projects,  I want to keep myself accountable, and actually finish my projects.There are some additional benefits that are not obvious at first. Thinking about how to decompose your project into achievable tasks forces you to ACTUALLY think hard about what you’re trying to do, it forces you to do a deep analysis. Once you break it down, you’ll have clear steps on how you’re going to achieve something, and you’ll also have some insight when and how you’re going to complete your project.Of course, I don’t think this is feasible for every little thing I do. I quickly found out it’s better to start immediately working on my idea, create something concrete, gather more information and to get a feeling is this something I’d really like to do or this was some passing whim. After I’m sure I find it fun (or useful), I’ll do some “project planning”.        Setting SMART goalsCouple of months ago my girlfriend (who is very smart) taught me about setting SMART goals. I keep forgetting what the acronym stands for, but I vividly remember when she first told me about it, it resonated with me. Well, instead of asking her for the 100th time what each letter means, I’ll now write it down:  S - Specific: Clearly define what you want to achieve, including details like who, what, where and why. (e.g., “I’ll build a RISC-V core”, becomes “I’ll build a basic, single cycle, 32-bit RISC-V core supporting IMAC instruction set to improve my digital design skills, and to become familiar with the RISC-V ecosystem”.  M - Measurable: Include criteria to track progress and know when you’ve succeeded, using numbers, percentages, or other data points.  A - Achievable: Ensure the goal is challenging but realistic, with resources and capabilities to reach it.  R - Relevant: Confirm the goal matters to your broader objectives and is worthwhile.  T - Time-bound: Set a specific deadline or time frame for completion, creating urgency and focus.  Task breakdownThe next thing I decided on is the Project and Task breakdown. I decided on the following:  I want to have the following hierarchy: Projects-&gt;Epics-&gt;Stories-&gt;Tasks.  Each project can have multiple Epics. Each Epic describes a significant feature that I need to develop or some area that I need to study that would take multiple months.  Epics are further decomposed into Stories. Each Story contains a meaningful unit of work that can be done in a month or so.  Stories are decomposed into tasks. Each task would represent a concrete action needed to complete a Story.Here is one hypothetical project example that for the hierarchy I’ve described above. Let’s say I want to design a floating-point unit. This would be my Project. Now, there are multiple ways how I would decompose this Project into Epics, but let’s say my approach is the following:  Floating point unit documentation,  Floating point unit design,  Floating point unit validation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).  etc.The 2nd Epic - Floating point unit design - I would further decompose into the following Stories:  Multiplication (F.MUL),  Leading Zero Counter (LZC),  Division (F.DIV),  Square root (F.SQRT),  etc.The F.MUL story can be decomposed into the following tasks:  Implement mantissa multiplication,  Implement normalization,  Implement exponent calculation,  Implement rounding,  Create a Formal verification environment,  Get a Formal proof of the F.MUL datapath,  etc.And here is a visualization of the above:flowchart LRA(Floating point unit)A --&gt; E1(Epic: FPU documentation)A --&gt; E2(Epic: FPU design)A --&gt; E3(Epic: FPU implementation on an FPGA)subgraph FPU documentationE1 --&gt; E1S1(...)endsubgraph FPU implementation on an FPGAE3 --&gt; E3S1(...)endsubgraph \"FPU Design\"E2 --&gt; E2S1(Story: Multiplication F.MUL)E2 --&gt; E2S2(Story: Leading Zero Counter LZC)E2 --&gt; E2S3(Story: Division F.DIV)E2 --&gt; E2S4(Story: Square root F.SQRT)E2S2 --&gt; E2S2T1(...)E2S3 --&gt; E2S3T1(...)E2S4 --&gt; E2S4T1(...)subgraph F.MULE2S1 --&gt; E2S1T1(Task: Implement mantissa multiplication)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T2(Task: Implement normalization)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T3(Task: Implement exponent calculation)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T4(Task: Implement rounding)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T5(Task: Create Formal verification environment)E2S1 --&gt; E2S1T6(Task: Get a Formal proof of the F.MUL datapath)endendChoosing tool for project and task planningWhen it came time to pick tool for project management I wanted a tool that supported the followingcriteria:  It must be free to use,  It must be a web based tool because I’m working on multiple machines and multiple operating systems,  It should have an establishaed reputation, i.e., there should be an existing user base, I don’twant the tool to be cancelled or disappear overnight,  It should support building a hierarchy of Projects-&gt;Epics-&gt;Stories-&gt;Tasks as I’ve outlined previously,  It should allow me to keep track of time for each Task,  It should be possible to have a board (Kanban style) where I could see the task breakdown for the current month (Sprint),  Once I set it it up, it should be easy to use - I should be able to plan tasks for the current month witha couple of clicks, adding Tasks, Stories, Epics and Projects should be simple.There are bajillion tools that fit these criteria; I’ve spent a couple of days trying some of those. Thereare two tools that I really liked: JetBrains YouTrackand Notion. In the end I chose Notion, not because one tool is betterthan the other, it was simply a coin toss choice, and Notion won.        Retrospective: Using NotionIn retrospective, Notion was actually not that easy to set-up. It took me roughly 3 days to set up everything. In these 3 days I’ve included research, watching tutorials and all the trial and error before I got what I actually wanted. It might be a  skill issue, but I think the main reason for the non-ease-of-use is it has a very rich featurset. It takes some time to get familiar with the required features, tool flow and the intended way or work.I’ll mention two resources that actually got me started:  Anthropic’s Claude AI - It helped a lot when I started using Notion. Btw I’m notendorsing Claude above any other currently available LLMs, I used it because I had the fullsubscription at the time.  The Notion Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners on YouTube.This video helped ALOT. It’s long (roughly 2 hours) but it’s worth watching if you’re seriousabout using Notion. The video author also has lots of other videos on topics surrounding Notionand productivity in general. Fully recommend.  Using Notion to set things in motionFirst I’ll start with the results, and then I’ll provide a step-by-step solution on how to implementthis yourself in Notion.The solution I’ve built focuses around four main databases: one database containing Projects,one database containing Epics, one database containing all Stories and one database containing all Tasks. Each project gets its own separate page.The Projects database lists all the projects with their status, description, start and end date.                Notion database containing a list of Projects with the accompanying propertiesThe Epics database contains all Epics for all Projects. Each Epic is assigned to on or more Projects. Each Epic contains a list of Stories required to finish that particular Epic. The Estimated Hours, Actual Hours, Remaining Hours, and Progress are automatically calculated. Estimated and Actual Hours are sum of the same-named properties of all Stories contained inside an Epic.                Database containing list of all Epics. Estimated hours and Actual hours are automatically calculated by summing those properties for all the Stories contained in an EpicThe Stories database contains all Stories for all Projects. Each Story is assigned to one (or more)Epics. Estimated Hours, Actual Hours, Remaining Hours and Progress are automatically calculated.Like in the Epics database, the Estimated Hours and the Actual Hours are are calculated by summingthe values of the same-names properties for all Tasks contained within a Story.                Database containing list of all Stories. Estimated hours and Actual hours are automatically calculated by summing the same-named properties for all the Tasks contained inside a StoryThe Tasks database contains as list of Tasks for all Projects. Each Task is described with thefollowing properties:  Name of the task,  Task description,  Status (In progress, Ongoing, Done),  Estimated hours - time it takes to finish a task,  Actual Hours - time it took to finish a task,  Over-Under - automatically calculated property, describing if the task was over or under estimated,  Variance - time difference between the Estimated and Actual Hours. Also auto calculated.                Tasks database on the Backlog view. The Backlog view is used to see all the tasks that are not being worked on this month.Tasks that are going to be worked on in the current month are displayed on a board. The Kanban boardstyle is, in my opinion, a great tool to visually depict work at various stages of a process.                The Kanban board show which tasks are planned to be worked on this month, but are still not in progress, tasks I'm currently working on, and tasks I've finished this month.As I’ve mentioned before, each project gets a dedicated Project dashboard page. This page essentiallycontains a link to the Epics, Stories and Tasks databases, but it’s set up in such a way to providea clear overview of the Project.                Project dashboard pae showing list of Epics, Stories an Tasks related to the Project. Tasks are show in the Kanban board style.Tasks in the Project dashboard are displayed in two different views: Kanban style, and as a list of Project relatedtasks currently in the backlog.                List of tasks in the backlog for the selected Project.Steps to set up a Scrum-based project management system in NotionI’ve split the setup into the following steps:  Core database setup,  Create essential views,  Create project dashboard template,  Creating a project,  Sprint (month) planning and executionAfter you create a Notion account, you’ll be met with a default workspace. My suggestion is toremove the ‘New page’, ‘Welcome to Notion!’ and ‘To Do List’. Add everything under the ‘Private’section.Part 1: Core Database SetupStep 1: Create Projects Registry  Create a new page in Notion called “Project Management Hub”  Type /database and select “Database - Full page”  Name it “Projects”  Add properties:          Name (Title) - Project name      Status (Select) - Options: Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed      Description (Text) - Project description      Start Date (Date)      Target End Date (Date)      Step 2: Create Epics Database  On the Project Management Hub page, create another database  Type /database and select “Database - Full page”  Name it “Epics”  Add properties:          Name (Title) - Epic name      Projects (Relation) - Link to Projects Registry - Enable Two-way relation (Epics will appear in Projects database,and we’ll be able to use properties from the Epics database in Projects database)      Description (Text) - Epic description      Status (Formula) - From Stories (configure after Stories created)      Estimated Hours (Formula) - From Stories (configure after Stories database is created)      Actual Hours (Formula) - From Stories (configure after Stories created)              Notion: Rollup of rollupsThe Estimated Hours and Actual Hours should (in my opinion) be automatically calculated bysumming up values of same-named properties from all the Stories associated with a particular Epic. Unfortunately,Notion doesn’t support Rollups of Rollups, but fortunately there is a workaround for this. Wecan use formulas to calculate Estimated Hours and Actual Hours. I got this solution from thefollowing YouTube video: How to Create a Nested Rollup in Notion (rollup of a rollup) 2024 Tutorial with free template  Step 3: Create Stories Database  Create another database on the Project Management Hub page  Type /database and select “Database - Full page”  Name it “Stories”  Add properties:          Name (Title) - Story name      Projects (Relation) - Link to Projects database - Enable Two-way relation      Epic (Relation) - Link to Epics database - Enable Two-way relation      Description (Text) - Story description      Status (Formula) - From Tasks (configure after Tasks database is created)      Estimated Hours (Rollup) - Story time estimate (configure after Tasks created)      Actual Hours (Rollup) - From Tasks (configure after Tasks created)      Step 4: Create Tasks Database  Create another database on the Project Management Hub page  Type /database and select “Database - Full page”  Name it “Tasks”  Add properties:          Name (Title) - Task name      Project (Relation) - Link to Projects database - Enable Two-way relation      Story (Relation) - Link to Stories database - Enable Two-way relation      Epic (Rollup) - From Story -&gt; Epic. Configure: Relation: Story, Property: Epic, Show original      Description (Text) - Task description      Status (Status) - Options: Not started, In progress, Done      Month (Select) - Options: Backlog, January 2026, February 2026, March 2026, etc. Add yourown relevant months.      Estimated Hours (Number) - Time estimate      Actual Hours (Number) - Time logged      Step 5: Configure Rollup PropertiesIn Stories:  Click Actual Hours -&gt; Configure rollup  Relation: Tasks, Property: Actual Hours, Calculate: Sum  Click Estimated Hours -&gt; Configure rollup  Relation: Tasks, Property: Estimated Hours, Calculate: Sum  Click Status -&gt; Edit Property -&gt; Edit Formula. Formula:    length(prop(\"Tasks\").filter(current.prop(\"Month\").lower() == \"backlog\")) == length(prop(\"Tasks\").map(current.prop(\"Month\"))) ? \"Backlog\".style(\"red\", \"red_background\") : (length(prop(\"Tasks\").filter(current.prop(\"Status\").lower() == \"done\")) == length(prop(\"Tasks\").map(current.prop(\"Status\"))) ? \"Completed\".style(\"green\", \"green_background\") : \"In progress\".style(\"blue\", \"blue_background\"))        This will set the property automatically:          If all Tasks for the selected Story are in Backlog -&gt; Status = Backlog      If all Tasks for the selected property are Done -&gt; Status = Done      Otherwise -&gt; Status = In progress      In Epics:  Click Estimated Hours -&gt; Edit Property -&gt; Edit Formula  Formula:    sum(prop(\"Stories\").map(current.prop(\"Estimated Hours\")))        Click Actual Hours -&gt; Edit Property -&gt; Edit Formula    sum(prop(\"Stories\").map(current.prop(\"Actual Hours\")))        Click Status -&gt; Edit Property -&gt; Edit Formula. Formula:    length(prop(\"Stories\").filter(current.prop(\"Status\").lower() == \"backlog\")) == length(prop(\"Stories\").map(current.prop(\"Status\"))) ? \"Backlog\".style(\"red\", \"red_background\") : (length(prop(\"Stories\").filter(current.prop(\"Status\").lower() == \"completed\")) == length(prop(\"Stories\").map(current.prop(\"Status\"))) ? \"Completed\".style(\"green\", \"green_background\") : \"In progress\".style(\"blue\", \"blue_background\"))        This will set the property automatically:          If all Stories for the selected Epic are in Backlog -&gt; Status = Backlog      If all Stories for the selected property are Completed -&gt; Status = Completed      Otherwise -&gt; Status = In progress      Step 6: Add Calculated PropertiesIn Epics, add:  Remaining Hours (Formula):    prop(\"Estimated Hours\") - prop(\"Actual Hours\")        Progress % (Formula):    round(prop(\"Actual Hours\") / prop(\"Estimated Hours\") * 100)        Click Progress % -&gt; Edit property -&gt; Show as: BarIn Stories, add:  Remaining Hours (Formula):    prop(\"Estimated Hours\") - prop(\"Actual Hours\")        Progress % (Formula):    round(prop(\"Actual Hours\") / prop(\"Estimated Hours\") * 100)        Click Progress % -&gt; Edit property -&gt; Show as: BarIn Tasks, add:  Variance (Formula):    prop(\"Actual Hours\") - prop(\"Estimated Hours\")        Over/Under (Formula):    if(prop(\"Actual Hours\") &gt; prop(\"Estimated Hours\"), \"Over\".style(\"red\", \"background_red\"), if(prop(\"Actual Hours\") == 0, \"\", \"✓ Under\".style(\"green\", \"background_green\")))      Part 2: Create Essential ViewsViews for Epics  Full view (Table)          Rename view to: Full view      Group by: Projects        Default view (Table)          Show: Name, Projects, Status, Estimated Hours, Actual Hours, Progress %      Group by: Project        By Status (Board)          Group by: Status      Filter by Project as needed      Views for Stories  Full view (Table)          Rename view to: Full view      Group by Project      Sort by: Epic        Default view (Table)          Show: Name, Project, Epic, Status, Estimated Hours, Actual Hours, Progress %      Group by: Project      Sort by: Epic        By Epic (Table)          Group by: Epic      Show time tracking columns      Views for Tasks  Current Month (Board) - PRIMARY VIEW          Group by: Status      Filter: Month -&gt; Is -&gt; January 2026      Filter: Status -&gt; Is not -&gt; Backlog      Properties: Name, Project, Epic, Estimated Hours, Actual Hours      Sort: Project      This shows ALL current work across ALL projects!
