<p>I can see people screaming: “Are you insane? What drugs are you on? Why do you want to turn your 
fun activity into something that feels like some annoying and life-draining corporate project?” 
First of all, I don’t think the Scrum itself is stupid and life draining, it’s the 1000 other 
things like managers emphasizing and prioritizing writing Jira tickets and doing time estimates 
while you’re trying to deliver that bug fix on the Friday afternoon. This is not it. Here, you’re 
your own manager, and Scrum is just a way of keeping track of things. Besides there are 
numerous benefits, but the most important ones to me:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I want to keep track of my projects,</li>
  <li>I want to keep myself accountable, and actually finish my projects.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some additional benefits that are not obvious at first. Thinking about how to decompose your project into achievable tasks forces you to ACTUALLY think hard about what you’re trying to do, it forces you to do a deep analysis. Once you break it down, you’ll have clear steps on how you’re going to achieve something, and you’ll also have some insight when and how you’re going to complete your project.</p>

<p>Of course, I don’t think this is feasible for every little thing I do. I quickly found out it’s better to start immediately working on my idea, create something concrete, gather more information and to get a feeling is this something I’d really like to do or this was some passing whim. After I’m sure I find it fun (or useful), I’ll do some “project planning”.</p>

    <p class="header">Setting SMART goals</p><p>Couple of months ago my girlfriend (who is very smart) taught me about setting SMART goals. 
I keep forgetting what the acronym stands for, but I vividly remember when she first told me about it, 
it resonated with me. Well, instead of asking her for the 100th time what each letter means, 
I’ll now write it down:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>S - Specific</strong>: Clearly define <em>what</em> you want to achieve, including details like who, what, where and why. (e.g., “I’ll build a RISC-V core”, becomes “I’ll build a basic, single cycle, 32-bit RISC-V core supporting IMAC instruction set to improve my digital design skills, and to become familiar with the RISC-V ecosystem”.</li>
  <li><strong>M - Measurable</strong>: Include criteria to track progress and know when you’ve succeeded, using numbers, percentages, or other data points.</li>
  <li><strong>A - Achievable</strong>: Ensure the goal is challenging but realistic, with resources and capabilities to reach it.</li>
  <li><strong>R - Relevant</strong>: Confirm the goal matters to your broader objectives and is worthwhile.</li>
  <li><strong>T - Time-bound</strong>: Set a specific deadline or time frame for completion, creating urgency and focus.</li>
</ul>




  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="task-breakdown">Task breakdown</h2>

<p>The next thing I decided on is the Project and Task breakdown. I decided on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to have the following hierarchy: Projects-&gt;Epics-&gt;Stories-&gt;Tasks.</li>
  <li>Each project can have multiple Epics. Each Epic describes a significant feature that I need to develop or some area that I need to study that would take multiple months.</li>
  <li>Epics are further decomposed into Stories. Each Story contains a meaningful unit of work that can be done in a month or so.</li>
  <li>Stories are decomposed into tasks. Each task would represent a concrete action needed to complete a Story.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is one hypothetical project example that for the hierarchy I’ve described above. Let’s say I want to design a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit">floating-point unit</a>. This would be my Project. Now, there are multiple ways how I would decompose this Project into Epics, but let’s say my approach is the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Floating point unit documentation,</li>
  <li>Floating point unit design,</li>
  <li>Floating point unit validation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>The 2nd Epic - Floating point unit design - I would further decompose into the following Stories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Multiplication (F.MUL),</li>
  <li>Leading Zero Counter (LZC),</li>
  <li>Division (F.DIV),</li>
  <li>Square root (F.SQRT),</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>The F.MUL story can be decomposed into the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Implement mantissa multiplication,</li>
  <li>Implement normalization,</li>
  <li>Implement exponent calculation,</li>
  <li>Implement rounding,</li>
  <li>Create a Formal verification environment,</li>
  <li>Get a Formal proof of the F.MUL datapath,</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>And here is a visualization of the above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">flowchart LR

end
end

<h2 id="choosing-tool-for-project-and-task-planning">Choosing tool for project and task planning</h2>

<p>When it came time to pick tool for project management I wanted a tool that supported the following
criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It must be free to use,</li>
  <li>It must be a web based tool because I’m working on multiple machines and multiple operating systems,</li>
  <li>It should have an establishaed reputation, i.e., there should be an existing user base, I don’t
want the tool to be cancelled or disappear overnight,</li>
  <li>It should support building a hierarchy of Projects-&gt;Epics-&gt;Stories-&gt;Tasks as I’ve outlined previously,</li>
  <li>It should allow me to keep track of time for each Task,</li>
  <li>It should be possible to have a board (Kanban style) where I could see the task breakdown for 
the current month (Sprint),</li>
  <li>Once I set it it up, it should be easy to use - I should be able to plan tasks for the current month with
a couple of clicks, adding Tasks, Stories, Epics and Projects should be simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are bajillion tools that fit these criteria; I’ve spent a couple of days trying some of those. There
are two tools that I really liked: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/teams/management.html">JetBrains YouTrack</a>
and <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>. In the end I chose Notion, not because one tool is better
than the other, it was simply a coin toss choice, and Notion won.</p>

<div class="premonition info">
  <i class="premonition pn-info"></i>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="header">Retrospective: Using Notion</p><p>In retrospective, Notion was actually not that easy to set-up. It took me roughly 3 days to set up 
everything. In these 3 days I’ve included research, watching tutorials and all the trial and error 
before I got what I actually wanted. It might be a  skill issue, but I think the main reason for 
the non-ease-of-use is it has a very rich featurset. It takes some time to 
get familiar with the required features, tool flow and the intended way or work.</p>

<p>I’ll mention two resources that actually got me started:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Anthropic’s Claude AI - It helped a lot when I started using Notion. Btw I’m not
endorsing Claude above any other currently available LLMs, I used it because I had the full
subscription at the time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOf3QSBV29Y">The Notion Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners</a> on YouTube.
This video helped ALOT. It’s long (roughly 2 hours) but it’s worth watching if you’re serious
about using Notion. The video author also has lots of other videos on topics surrounding Notion
and productivity in general. Fully recommend.</li>

<p>First I’ll start with the results, and then I’ll provide a step-by-step solution on how to implement
this yourself in Notion.</p>

<p>The solution I’ve built focuses around four main databases: one database containing Projects,
one database containing Epics, one database containing all Stories and one database containing all 
Tasks. Each project gets its own separate page.</p>

<p>The Projects database lists all the projects with their status, description, start and end date.</p>

<p>The Epics database contains all Epics for all Projects. Each Epic is assigned to on or more Projects. 
Each Epic contains a list of Stories required to finish that particular Epic. The Estimated Hours, 
Actual Hours, Remaining Hours, and Progress are automatically calculated. Estimated and Actual Hours 
are sum of the same-named properties of all Stories contained inside an Epic.</p>

Epics. Estimated Hours, Actual Hours, Remaining Hours and Progress are automatically calculated.
Like in the Epics database, the Estimated Hours and the Actual Hours are are calculated by summing
the values of the same-names properties for all Tasks contained within a Story.</p>

contains a link to the Epics, Stories and Tasks databases, but it’s set up in such a way to provide
a clear overview of the Project.</p>

<p>I’ve split the setup into the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Core database setup,</li>
  <li>Create essential views,</li>
  <li>Create project dashboard template,</li>
  <li>Creating a project,</li>
  <li>Sprint (month) planning and execution</li>
</ol>

<p>After you create a Notion account, you’ll be met with a default workspace. My suggestion is to
remove the ‘New page’, ‘Welcome to Notion!’ and ‘To Do List’. Add everything under the ‘Private’
section.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-core-database-setup">Part 1: Core Database Setup</h3>

<h4 id="step-1-create-projects-registry">Step 1: Create Projects Registry</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new page in Notion called “<strong>Project Management Hub</strong>”</li>
  <li>Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/database</code> and select “Database - Full page”</li>
  <li>Name it “<strong>Projects</strong>”</li>
  <li>Add properties:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name</strong> (Title) - Project name</li>
      <li><strong>Status</strong> (Select) - Options: Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong> (Text) - Project description</li>
      <li><strong>Start Date</strong> (Date)</li>
      <li><strong>Target End Date</strong> (Date)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-2-create-epics-database">Step 2: Create Epics Database</h4>

<ol>
  <li>On the Project Management Hub page, create another database</li>
  <li>Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/database</code> and select “Database - Full page”</li>
  <li>Name it “<strong>Epics</strong>”</li>
  <li>Add properties:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name</strong> (Title) - Epic name</li>
      <li><strong>Projects</strong> (Relation) - Link to Projects Registry - Enable Two-way relation (Epics will appear in Projects database,
and we’ll be able to use properties from the Epics database in Projects database)</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong> (Text) - Epic description</li>
      <li><strong>Status</strong> (Formula) - From Stories (configure after Stories created)</li>
      <li><strong>Estimated Hours</strong> (Formula) - From Stories (configure after Stories database is created)</li>
      <li><strong>Actual Hours</strong> (Formula) - From Stories (configure after Stories created)</li>

    <p class="header">Notion: Rollup of rollups</p><p>The Estimated Hours and Actual Hours should (in my opinion) be automatically calculated by
summing up values of same-named properties from all the Stories associated with a particular Epic. Unfortunately,
Notion doesn’t support Rollups of Rollups, but fortunately there is a workaround for this. We
can use formulas to calculate Estimated Hours and Actual Hours. I got this solution from the
following YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGOsRNnh6fg">How to Create a Nested Rollup in Notion (rollup of a rollup) 2024 Tutorial with free template</a></p>
